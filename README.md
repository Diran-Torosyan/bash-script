# bash-script
this was my first time using shell scripting

created simple script to gather user info, check whether or not a computer is running slow
as well as checking whether a computer has internet connection by pinging google.com

this is a simple script that i believe would be used in an IT profession
potentially can have additions to better fit someones use case, or be modified for a different purpose
